/* The objective of this project is to identify and report the names and IDs of customers whose orders were returned.
We will utilize SQL to join multiple tables and extract the necessary information.
The results will be ordered by the customer ID in ascending order.
This analysis will help in identifying customer return behavior and can be used to enhance customer service, manage inventory, and improve overall business operations.*/
