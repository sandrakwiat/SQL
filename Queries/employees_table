This query is designed to retrieve information about employees based on specific criteria requested by the company's CEO.
The CEO asked to identify individuals who are either over 40 years old or earn more than 70,000, as this information is needed for making personnel changes 
within the teams. The query filters the employee data from two tables: `employee_demographics` for age and `employee_salary` for salary, and then combines the results
to generate the relevant list of employees.


SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Old Man' AS Label
FROM employee_demographics
WHERE age > 40 AND gender = 'Male'
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Old Lady' AS Label
FROM employee_demographics
WHERE age > 40 AND gender = 'Female'
UNION
SELECT first_name, last_name, 'Highly Paid Employee' AS Label
FROM employee_salary
WHERE salary > 70000
ORDER BY first_name, last_name;
